# Exploratory Data Analysis of New Zealand Earnings and Cost of Living

## Project Overview
This project explores earnings trends in New Zealand using official data from
Stats NZ’s Quarterly Employment Survey (QES). The analysis focuses on industry-level
hourly earnings and examines how earnings trends compare with changes in the
household cost of living over time.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate practical exploratory data analysis (EDA)
skills using real-world government datasets.

## Data Sources
- **Quarterly Employment Survey (QES)** – Stats NZ  
- **Household Living-costs Price Index (HLPI)** – Stats NZ  

Both datasets are publicly available and used in cleaned and filtered form.

---

## Key Objectives
- Clean and explore complex government datasets
- Analyse hourly earnings across industries
- Convert hourly earnings into estimated annual salaries
- Visualise long-term earnings and cost-of-living trends
- Provide economic context without forcing incompatible data merges

---

## Key Assumptions
- Annual salary estimates assume a 40-hour work week and 52 working weeks per year
- Cost-of-living data is analysed separately due to different data granularity
- The analysis focuses on trends and relative comparison, not exact affordability

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights
- IT and professional service industries show higher estimated annual earnings
- Earnings in these industries have grown steadily over time
- Cost-of-living pressure has increased consistently, highlighting the importance
  of strong earnings growth for financial resilience

---

## Limitations
- Earnings data is industry-based, not region-based
- Cost-of-living data is aggregated at the household level
- Salary estimates are indicative and not take-home pay

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates end-to-end exploratory data analysis using real New Zealand
labour market data. It highlights the importance of understanding data structure,
making transparent assumptions, and communicating insights clearly.
